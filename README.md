## 🌟 Why C Language?

C is one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages in the world. It is:

- 🔧 **Close to hardware**: Ideal for systems programming and embedded systems.
- 🚀 **Fast and efficient**: Offers low-level memory access and direct manipulation.
- 📚 **Foundation of many modern languages**: Languages like C++, Java, and Python are influenced by C.
- 🎓 **Essential in academia**: Common in university-level computer science and engineering programs.
